            You have to remember to prepare your food hygienically,
            put it in a suitable vacuum bag and when it's done you can store it in the freezer.
            (This does require a food vacuum machine)</p>

          <p>It's important to understand the difference between “use by” and “best before” dates.
            The “use by” date tells you when the food is no longer safe to eat.
            The “best before” dates are about quality, the food is still safe to eat after.</p>

          <p>Drying is a good way of preserving food like fruits, vegetables, herbs and meat. Most types of foods can be dried by using an oven, with a dehydrator or in the sun. Drying is also a way for you to save money, not wasting food by worrying so much about the expiration date.
          Dry food can be healthier, especially fruit that has a greater concentration of fiber and antioxidants than fresh fruits.

            This will help you see the items you should use first when you eiter open your refrigerator, freezer
