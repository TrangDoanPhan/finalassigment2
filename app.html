        <p>There is a point in your life where you have to be independent and your finances aren't the greatest.
          You might then want to save money and be sensible with your choices.
          With this solution you have the opportunity to increase your knowledge of food,
          but also learn how to waste less food. Furthermore, it will be beneficial for your economy and for the environment.
          For instance when you are buying vegetables such as cauliflower,
          did you know that the leaves are edible too?
          <br>Our main solution to our challenge is our nOwaste app.
          This app is designed to help you waste as little food as possible and
           it’s made to be easy for anyone to use.
          <br>So why not use the app to search for the food item you have in your fridge and want to buy,
          and get the full benefit of your food. Even better, get inspiration to make a dish of something you
          maybe didn't know you could eat. </p>

        <h4>Startpage</h4>
        <p>You will get a little information about nowaste. To get to the next step you have to click on the “GET STARTED” button.</p>

        <h4>Categories</h4>
        <p>Here you have the opportunity to select the food item you want to get more information about and recipes that include the food.</p>

        <h4>Select item</h4>
        <p>If you click on the fruit category, it will bring you to this page where it will display all different fruits alphabetically. You can also search for the fruit you are looking for in the search bar.</p>

        <h4>Information</h4>
        <p>On this page you get valuable details about the fruit. How they are best stored, preserved, their durability, etc..
          On the bottom of the page, there is a large button that says: “Recipes”.</p>

        <h4>Recipes</h4>
        <p>Here you can select and search for the recipe that includes the food item.</p>
